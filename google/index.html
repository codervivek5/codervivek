                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI love you because you are the medicine to every pain I feel.
                I plan to spend the rest of my life with you.
                Thanks for the beautiful love you give me.

                <br><br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your love is food to my soul. Morning, afternoon and night, all I
                need is you.
                Today, tomorrow and forever, I vow to give you all the happiness you deserve.
                Your love remains the light that drives out the darkness in every moment I feel alone.
                <br><br>
                I love you, baby.

                I will never say goodbye to you because I will love you forever.
                Every difficulty of tomorrow
                will I
                face as long as
                you remain in my life.
                The happiness you bring to my soul compares to nothing in the world because I feel fulfilled knowing
                that you are my
                girl forever.
                If you miss me.

                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

                Even money can’t buy happiness in my heart when I see your face. I long to hear you
                say my
                name. It sounds
                better when it is coming out from your lips. You’re my heart, so don’t go away because I cannot
                survive
                without a soul.
                I love you forever.
